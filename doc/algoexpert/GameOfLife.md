#Game of Life

LIFE is a multicellular communal organism that inhabits the deserts of Flatland. 
The desert is organized in a square array with each square capable of holding one 
LIFE cell. LIFE generations mark the passage of time, each generation bringing 
births and deaths to the LIFE community.

To follow the history of such a community, place LIFE cells into their initial 
positions in the desert. Count the passing generations by observing these rules.

The immediate neighbors of a cell are those cells occupying the eight horizontally, 
vertically, and diagonally adjacent cells.

If a LIFE cell has fewer than two immediate neighbors, it dies of loneliness. 

If a LIFE cell has more than three immediate neighbors, it dies of overcrowding.

If an empty square has exactly three LIFE cells as immediate neighbors, a new cell 
is born in the square.

Births and deaths all take place exactly at the change of generations. Thus a dying 
cell may help birth a new one, but a newborn cell may not resurrect a dying cell, nor 
may one dying cell stave off death for another by lowering the local population density.
Statement of the Theme

Write a program that simulates a LIFE community. The input should be the initial positions 
of the community’s cells, and the output an aerial view of the community at each generation.

Find the 9th and 10th generation being the first one the following:
